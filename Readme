##### Confidence Level Analysis ###

This program will generate a plot based on whether the data given by the user lies in the confidence interval or not.
There are only three colors used in the chart: White, Blue and Red.
For each data taken as an input by the user, a line on y-axis is drawn to indicate the point.
White occurs when the user input data lies in the confidence interval
Blue occurs when the user input data lies above the confidence interval
Red occurs when the user input data lies below the confidence interval
